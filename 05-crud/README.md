# CRUD

Create, Read, Update, Delete.

These are the basic Data Access operations.  In this project you will build a basic command line application (CLI) that allows you to take read and write notes directly from the command line into a .json file.

Along the way you'll learn about Model Objects and File IO (one of Node's 3 super-powers).

## Specifications


1. For each _basic model_ file in this [demo app](https://github.com/elewa-academy/Modular-Design/tree/master/docs_src/05-crud/crud-app):
    * Write the model object
    * Test the model object in your /tests folder

2. For each _json model_ file:
    * Write the model object
      * User Stories:
        * Create
        * Read
        * Update
        * Delete
        * Initialize (creates .json file with empty DB object)
        * Reset (clears nextID & data)
        * Set name of DB
        * See a helpful message or error after each operation
    * Test the model objecti in your /tests folder
3. Write a Node.js Handler & View.  No need for a Logic or Controller	
4. Build a repo for this project and include it on your portfolio.


Challenge:
