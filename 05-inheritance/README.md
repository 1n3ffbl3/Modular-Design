## Specifications

To witness the power of inheritance we will build an application that allows users to interact with multiple data types.  You will build a zoo application that allows a user to keep track of 3 types of animal:
* kangaroos
* orcas
* swallows
Each animal will be stored in a separate model object.

1. Create a planning chart for your application
2. Write tests for each module
3. Build the application with the simplest model
4. Complete the rest of the inheritance exercises and create an app for each
5. Code reviews!
