		most basic command line text editor
		plan
			most basic commander app
			mvclh commander app, crud model with array
			replace array with fs
			that should be it?
		how it works
			create
				wraps touch
				fs writes whatever's after that
			read
				fs reads the contents
				logs to console
			update
				finds designated file
				overwrites with next args
			delete
				wraps rm
		resources
			comm tuts
