	upjs
	george mvc
	mvclh
		- basic unit tests for each
		- repo with two template markdowns
			master
			project
		- build-time diagram
			for this project
			for modules project too
		- browser
		george refactored
		calcs (a few basics)
		samples
			inverted
				tictactoe
	async
		calc
			console
			sync x async
	crud
		- app/comp 
		models
			non-persistent
				connect to html/css
			persistent
				read/write json
	commander
		- servicise the crud
		- install -g
		- can access same file from anywhere
		a command line crud app
	full editor
		- can edit files where you are
		now takes paths instead of id's 

	awesome final project
		auto-generate app/component directory structure

finished codes
	- single responsibility principle
	ultra practical javascript
	george's mvc stuff
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwZ5yO60gJk&t=2s
		and the matching code
	cleancalc
		v+h -> t x b
	mvclh
		- put it all in, pick it apart together and alone
		components
			logic & controller
				f's
				oops
			models
				array
				variable
				object
				model object last result
				model object multiple last results
		app.js
			oop
				logic object
			proced
				require math functions
				call them in order
			build objec
				require functions
				set as props in controller
				operate - this[input](a,b) -> result or error
	async mvclh 
		- callbacks only
		oop x f'al
		proc x oop
		t x b
	command app
		crud app
		commander.js
		model
			fs
			a text file
	final
		most basic command line text editor
		plan
			most basic commander app
			mvclh commander app, crud model with array
			replace array with fs
			that should be it?
		how it works
			create
				wraps touch
				fs writes whatever's after that
			read
				fs reads the contents
				logs to console
			update
				finds designated file
				overwrites with next args
			delete
				wraps rm
		resources
			comm tuts
