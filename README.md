In this series of projects you will learn 
* Separation of Concerns
* to build small, single responsibility modules
* to assemble these modules into applications
* asynchronous programming with callbacks
* testing modules
* packaging modules into services
* CRUD applications
* to build a CLI around a CRUD service
* to build an API around a CRUD service

youll have a repo with a branch for each step after crud.  master at the end will have you vfs code and gh-pages frontend

Here you'll apply Separation of Concerns to application design.  by the end of this series of projects you'll understand how to build applications out of small, reusable modules. As usual you'll make a gallery page for this series of projects, by the end it will have these things:
* PJS repo
* mvc repo for george's project
* an MVC-LH calc repo with a bunch of hybrid apps
* an mvclh crud repo with a bunch of hybrid apps
* a basic crud app for the terminal w/ Commander
* a basic terminal-based text editor
* an mvc-lh directory generator you can use to bootstrap projects
